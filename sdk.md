# Installing the KnightOS SDK

## General instructions

If you're on a Unix-like system (i.e. Linux, OS X, BSD), run the following
commands to install the SDK:

```sh
wget http://www.knightos.org/install-sdk
chmod +x install-sdk
./install-sdk
```
## Archlinux

On Archlinux, there is an AUR package named `knightos-sdk` which you can install with an aur helper like `aurman` which does (almost) all the work for you which may save you some time.

<strong>Note:</strong>
Windows users should use one of the various Unix subsystems available for
Windows, such as Ubuntu on Windows or Cygwin.

The same procedure can be used to update the SDK. Once the SDK is installed, use 
`knightos --help` to see how it works.
