title: Contributing to KnightOS
---

There are many ways for people of all backgrounds to help out with KnightOS.
We're very happy that you are interested in being one of them! There's always
something to do. Before you do anything, though, you should introduce yourself
to the rest of the community in our [IRC channel](/irc/).
Be patient, though, not everyone is listening all the time.

## Getting Involved as a User

You may not be a programmer, but you can help us do the programming! There are
a number of things you can help with:

* Help triage tickets in our issue tracker.
* Improve documentation and proof-read blog posts. Programmers write most of the
    content on this site and we aren't exactly known for being good at grammir.
* Help write the user manual. Simply by using KnightOS and getting a feel for
    it, you can help others learn faster by improving our user manual.
* Provide our programmers with feedback and ideas - we depend on this to figure
    out what people want to see the most, and to make sure we're doing things
    right.
* Talk in our IRC channel and make people feel welcome! A quiet IRC channel can
  scare off newcomers.
* Spread the good word! You can do some evangelism and get more people involved
    and excited about the project.

## Getting started as a Programmer

Though we do love our non-programming contributors, we'd be lying if we said the
bulk of the work wasn't writing code. A lot of people get intimidated by
KnightOS when they hear things like "50,000 lines of assembly" and "kernel
development". If that's your thing, we have totally got work for you. However,
to the surprise of many people, we also have plenty of high-level code to write!

We currently have active projects written in assembly, C, Python, HTML/CSS, and
JavaScript. If none of those are your slice of tea, then bring up an idea for
something new! Being an official KnightOS project is as easy as being useful and
well-maintained. If you have an idea, come join the team and make it happen. To
contribute to established projects, you can either find something you want to
work on and simply get started, or check out "[What can I do for
KnightOS?](/contributing/what-can-i-do.html)" if you can't decide.

When you're ready to get started, head over to our [contributor
guidelines](/contributing/guidelines.html) for a little direction.
You also might need the KnightOS.
