For the most part, KnightOS devs prefer to collaborate over IRC (Internet Relay
Chat). We hang out in `#knightos` on `irc.libera.chat`. While chatting with us,
please observe these rules:

* Be nice.
* Stay mostly on topic. Off topic discussion is permitted in `#knightos-ot`.
* Don't ask for release dates. We don't do release dates here.
